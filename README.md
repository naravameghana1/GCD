# GCD
A GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) machine is a hardware implementation that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It can be built using a combination of data path and control path components. Here's a high-level description of how you can design a GCD machine using data path and control path:

#Data Path:
The data path is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations on data. In this case, the data path will consist of registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and multiplexers.

#Input Registers: Two input registers are used to store the two numbers for which we want to find the greatest common divisor.
Comparator: A comparator is used to compare the two numbers stored in the input registers.
#ALU: An ALU is used to perform arithmetic operations, such as subtraction and modulo, on the numbers.
#Output Register: An output register is used to store the computed greatest common divisor.
Control Path:
The control path is responsible for controlling the operations performed in the data path. It consists of control signals and a control unit.

Control Signals: Control signals are used to enable/disable specific operations in the data path components. For example, the control signals determine when to load values into the input registers, when to perform subtraction in the ALU, etc.
Control Unit: The control unit generates the control signals based on the current state of the GCD machine and the inputs.
Control Flow:
The GCD machine follows a specific control flow to compute the greatest common divisor. Here's a simplified control flow:

Initialize: The machine initializes the input registers with the two numbers.
Compare: The machine compares the two numbers using the comparator to determine the next step.
Subtract: If the first number is greater than the second number, the machine subtracts the second number from the first number using the ALU.
Update: The machine updates the values in the input registers with the result of the subtraction.
Repeat: The machine repeats the steps until the two numbers become equal.
Output: Once the two numbers are equal, the greatest common divisor is found, and it is stored in the output register.
Control Unit Design:
The control unit is designed using a finite state machine (FSM) or a microcontroller. It defines the control signals for each state of the machine and determines the transitions between states based on the comparison result and other conditions.

The control unit generates control signals to enable/disable operations in the data path components based on the current state.
It also updates the control signals based on the comparison result to determine whether to subtract or update the values.
This is a simplified overview of how you can design a GCD machine using data path and control path components. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific hardware architecture and design choices
